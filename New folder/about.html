                <p style="max-width: 400px;">
                    ReNewed Life Church is a place where you can come as you are. We just want to show love like our Father shows us through His Son, giving us a way to have a relationship with Him. We are a church of unity—when you visit, we want you to feel at home and leave better than you came. Our pastors are passionate about unity and love, so whether you come to our church or visit our website, we want you to feel loved no matter where you are.<br><br>
                    Our pastor always teaches us to grow a personal relationship with GOD and JESUS, getting to know Him for ourselves so He can change us and prepare us for whenever we leave this earth—because nobody knows their time. We may not be the biggest church, but we love to serve GOD with all our hearts, minds, and souls. When you stop by ReNewed Life, it’s a place where you can let go and let GOD—a place where you can be free to laugh, have fun, and worship the JESUS way. <span style="color:#a6192e;font-weight:bold;">BAM!</span>
